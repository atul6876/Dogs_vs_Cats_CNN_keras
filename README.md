# Dogs_vs_Cats_CNN_keras
Classic binary image classification using Convolutional Neural Network Model built using Keras with TensorFlow backend.

This repository contains the code to predict whether the picture contains the image of a dog or a cat using a CNN model trained on the images from the kaggle dataset (not all the images, but I use image augmentation techniques that ensure that the model sees a new "image" at each training epoch. I also use pretrained models with deeper architectures for image classification. I have used Keras's blog on building and compiling a CNN model as a template for most of my code and directory structure.
